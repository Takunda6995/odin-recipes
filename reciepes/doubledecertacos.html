    <h1>Double Decer Tacos</h1>
    <div class="recipe">

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The best tacos! A soft shell taco is layered with refried beans, 
            then wrapped around a hard <br>shell taco, which is filled with seasoned 
            ground beef and topped with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, sour cream and
            fresh guacamole. You can top it<br> with whatever you like, but I recommend loading it 
            up! Also, if you don't eat meat, put melted cheese on the soft <br>shell, and the refried beans in the hard.</p>
        <h3>ingredience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li>⅔ cup water</li>
            <li>12 prepared crisp taco shells</li>
            <li>2 avocados</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
            <li>1 fresh lime, juiced</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>12 (7 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
            <li>¼ red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>
                
                <p>Place the ground beef in a skillet over medium heat, and<br>
                    sprinkle about 3/4 of the packet of taco seasoning over<br> 
                    the meat. Cook and stir the ground beef, breaking it up <br>
                    as it cooks, until the beef is browned and crumbly, 10 <br>
                    to 15 minutes. Drain the excess grease.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mash the refried beans with the water in a small saucepan,<br> 
                    and sprinkle with the rest of the seasoning packet. Heat <br>
                    the refried beans over low heat until simmering.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                
                <p>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place the crisp<br> 
                    taco shells on a baking sheet, and warm them in the preheated<br>
                    oven for 3 to 5 minutes</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                
                <p>To make the guacamole, peel, seed, and mash the avocados in a <br>
                    bowl with 1 tablespoon of sour cream, the lime juice, and salt<br> 
                    and pepper to taste, and set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>

                <p>To build the tacos, spread each flour tortilla with about 2  <br>
                    tablespoons of heated refried beans. Wrap the tortilla gently <br>
                    around a crisp tortilla shell. Spread about 2 tablespoons of ground <br>
                    beef along the bottom of the crisp shell, and sprinkle about 2 <br>
                    tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese on top of the meat. Top the <br>
                    cheese with shredded lettuce, a sprinkle of chopped tomato and onion,<br> 
                    and a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.</p>
